            The problem that this test contains is an actual challenge that we
            faced during the development of our custom account area.

            The main focus is on data manipulation and presenting order history
            information to a customer by bundling the products from an API call
            in a structured and more readable way.
          </p>
          <p>
            The minimum requirement is to create the responsive order history
            cards as per the design file below. Anything additional is at your
            discretion. If you have applied for a senior position then we would
            also like you to write at least one test of your choice.
